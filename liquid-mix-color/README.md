  - Smooth fluid dynamics simulation
  - Particle-based rendering
  - Realistic liquid physics
  - Color blending and mixing
- **Interactive Color Mixing**:
  - Click to add colors
  - Drag to create patterns
  - Multiple color palettes
  - Real-time color blending
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Smooth color gradients
  - Flowing liquid appearance
  - Particle trails
  - Dynamic lighting effects
- **Performance Optimized**:
  - Efficient canvas rendering
  - Optimized particle system
  - Smooth 60 FPS animations

## Technical Stack
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Advanced 2D rendering
- **CSS3**: UI styling and layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript**:
