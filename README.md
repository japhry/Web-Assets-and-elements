## How to Run a Project

1. Open a project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. If a project uses source-only files (`.pug`, `.scss`, `.ts`), make sure compiled outputs (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`) exist.

Windows quick open example:

```powershell
cd "product-cards"
start index.html
```

## Recommended Workflow for Updates

1. Edit one project at a time.
2. Keep CSS and JS separated where possible.
3. Test both desktop and mobile layouts.
4. Commit per project folder for clean history.

## Notes

- `pixelcare-hospital-triage-and-management-dashboard` is the active renamed version.
- Some older source templates may require manual compile/export depending on original format.

## License

Use these assets for learning, experiments, and adaptation. For production use, review external media/resource licenses used inside each project.
